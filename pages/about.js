    <h2>About Me</h2><br></br>
       <p> I am a Full Stack Web Developer presently completing my Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp through Hyperion DEV.<br></br>
           My passion for design, creativity and persevering through projects is what I enjoy about coding.<br></br>
           Each assignment or coding project is never the same as it presents the following:</p>
       <ul>
           <li> To Learn New Trends and Technology</li>
           <li> To Improve On Existing Code or Solutions</li>
           <li> To Contribute To The Development Community</li>

       </ul>    
       
  <h2>What Drives Me?</h2><br></br>
     <p> Having worked extensively in both IT and Training Environments, I have learnt overtime that not everyone will view code or even who you are the same way.<br></br>
         With never having had a recognised IT Qualification or Degree there was always a concern that I may not be fit to code or have an aptitude for it.<br></br>
         I find that having taken all of this into account, enrolling on the boot camp, was a step in the right direction.</p>

<p> It has forced me too: </p>

         <ul>
           <li> Re-Engineer My Thought Processes </li>
           <li> Redefine My Career</li>
           <li> Always Ask The Question </li>
           <li>To Never Be Afraid Of The Unknown</li>
           <li>To Believe You Can Code No Matter What</li>

       </ul>  

    <p> A constant drive to always be ahead of the curve and to be excellent is what inspires me to keep going.</p>

<h2>Career Aspirations</h2><br></br>
     <p>I would love to be part of an organization or team that encourages growth, that enhances systems and processes and that will allow me to function in a Full Stack Web Developer Role.<br></br>
        Over time I would like to grow into a Senior DEV Role or even transition into starting my own consultancy.</p>
